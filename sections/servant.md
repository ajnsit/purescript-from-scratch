## Basics - Type Level Haskell

Servant is a type level API. So your first stop would be to understand the basics of type level programming in Haskell. Here I list 3 things that you must understand in order to grok servant -

1. [Phantom types](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Phantom_types)
2. [DataKinds](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20558648/what-is-the-datakinds-extension-of-haskell)
3. [Type families](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/school/to-infinity-and-beyond/pick-of-the-week/type-families-and-pokemon)

## Techniques - Type Level API Implementation

Then read this [article on how to implement a minimal Servant like API](https://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/11/implementing-a-minimal-version-of-haskell-servant/).

## Round off with Specific Knowledge

Then at the end perhaps read the [Official Servant tutorial](https://docs.servant.dev/en/stable/tutorial/).

That should give you a good idea of how Servant works.
