# Purescript From Scratch

A comprehensive and practical tutorial for people to learn Purescript without any prior experience with functional programming.

# Why Purescript

Purescript is amazing! It's a very powerful language that compiles to Javascript, and gives you everything you need to build supercharged, resilient, and performant web applications.

It's also the only option you have if you want a **pure**, **functional** programming language for the web, featuring a **strong static type system**, providing **powerful abstractions** for writing code, and no runtime.

Why are these things good? Because functional programming techniques let you write highly expressive and performant code, and purity and statically checked types guarantee the correctness of the program, providing extremely quick feedback and high productivity.

# Why this tutorial

Purescript is a relatively young programming language. Functional programming is very different from other paradigms and has only recently started to become popular amongst mainstream programmers. This means that for programmers that have been using other languages for a while, there are quite a few things to learn, and perhaps just as many things to *unlearn*.

This can be an insurmountable barrier for many people, despite many excellent resources freely available online. I have been thinking about how to make it easier for people to learn Purescript, and I believe the following strategy should be effective -

1. Divide content into bite sized pieces based on how it's *used*. Go over each part separately and comprehensively
2. Provide *lots* and *lots* of independently runnable examples
3. Let people tinker with the examples and see the results

This is my attempt to provide such a resource for Purescript.

# Work in Progress

Ongoing work in progress sections are in /sections. Currently they are just notes and scribblings off the top of my head as I think of things to write about. They need massive reorganisation and fleshing out.

Sections which have crossed a threshold of a certain level of completeness, and are deemed somewhat readable and useful, will be linked here from the README.
